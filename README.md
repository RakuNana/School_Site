# School_Site
No mistakes this time

A website I'm making for school. I'm uploading this so others can help me debug it. Currently I'm trying to get it to use a social login.
The one I'm using is social-auth-app-django however, It keeps giving me an error after I get github to auth. "NoneType" object has no attribute to "provider"
I have an idea of what the problem maybe but, I can't seem to fix it.

If you want to help me debug it, GREAT! Just a few things to note, ONE. I erased my db.sqlite3 file because it had my info in it, you'll have to create your
own. TWO I deleted my Github keys and secret, so again you'll have to create your own.

If you want to see what the site looks like, as well as see the problem in action, the site is https://rakunana.pythonanywhere.com 
It's bare bones, so don't expect greatness or whatever, I just need a grade :P
